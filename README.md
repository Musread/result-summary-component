# Result summary component

Hi everyone üñê !

This is a GitHub page for another [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) project done !

To be honest, I completely turned my back to web development for a while. This project was supposed to be finished for a long time. But better last than never !

# Overview

You can look at the project [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). And this is my [solution](https://musread.github.io/result-summary-component/).

## Packages that I used

As always :

- [Node Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

# What I learned making this project üëç

## Box shadows with different colors

I've always used the _box-shadow_ property with the black color. With this project, I learned that using a different color can apply a better perpective.

# The difficulties I met building this project ü•µ

## The _Block-Element-Modifier_ architecture

The problem wasn't the BEM architecture itself, It was more choosing names for HTML classes while following the BEM rules.

# Author

I don't have a website yet, because I have no ideas about the design. But here's my FrontendMentor profile : [@musread](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/musread)
